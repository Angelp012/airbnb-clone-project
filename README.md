# Airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a backend simulation of a real-world booking platform. It is built to deliver a reliable and scalable system that handles user interactions, property listings, reservations, and payment processing. The project focuses on developing secure and efficient backend systems that replicate Airbnbâ€™s core features using modern tools and best practices.

# Project Goals
* User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
* Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
* Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
* Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
* Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
* Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

# Technology Stack
* Django: Python-based web framework used to build the backend logic and RESTful APIs.
* Django REST Framework: A toolkit built on top of Django that makes it easier to create and manage APIs.
* PostgreSQL: open-source relational database used to store and manage application data like users,properties and bookings.
* GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
* Celery: A tool that runs jobs in the background such as sending notifications or processing payments.
* Redis: Used for caching and session management.
* Docker: Guarantees standardized development, testing, and deployment environments.
* CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
